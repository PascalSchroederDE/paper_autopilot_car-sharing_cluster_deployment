In 2035, according to forecasts, the production of autonomous cars will have been raised up to 48 million per year.\textsuperscript{cmp.\cite{1}} This new technology will change our way and our understanding of mobility completely. In the future not everybody will have his own car - not only because of autonomous vehicles but also because of other problems like increasing urbanization and ensuing lack of parking spaces as well as pollutant problems.

For facing this change in the world of mobility the EU commission set up the AUTOPILOT project, which should take care of autonomous driving, an \acs{IoT} infrastructure and last also services for using those new technologies and possibilities. One of them is the car sharing service developed in the IBM Research Lab in Dublin.

In this work the AUTOPILOT project as well as the car sharing project will be introduced and described. Also the underlying technologies of the car sharing service will be listed and explained. This is the basis knowledge for the main part of this work - moving the car sharing service and all its components from a local deployment to a deployment within a cluster on IBM Cloud. The way how this can be done will be described and the success of the movement to the cluster will be evaluated at the end of this work.
