# Deployment of Autopilot Car Sharing Service and requirements within IBM Cloud Cluster
======

The AUTOPILOT project is a Large-Scale Pilot (LSP) by the European Commission. Those LSPs include five pilots as well as two coordination and support actions. Thereby the AUTOPILOT project takes care of using Internet of Things (IoT) for connecting autonomous driving to a larger environment like traffic monitoring systems, car parks, traffic light radars or just other vehicles.

This paper will describe the car sharing service itself as well as underlying technologies like Apache Kafka, OSRM or MongoDB. Furthermore it will be explained how to dockerize this app and all its affiliations and how to deploy it on a Kubernetes Cluster hosted on IBM Cloud
